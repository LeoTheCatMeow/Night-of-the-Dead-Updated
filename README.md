# Night of the Dead Updated

Disclaimer: I take no credit for the base game. This is only a personal attempt to bugfix and keep the game up and running smoothly in SC2 Arcade, with potential QOL or community requested updates. There may be a small amount of experimental features and personal explorations, but I will do my best to keep the game stable.

# Current Change & Bugfix Tracklist

8.7.2020
1. Fixed a bug that prevents Pathfinder from leveling up
2. Rewrote item purchasing & magazine dropping code to avoid a bug causing mags to get stuck in an invisble slot, leading to various ammo related issues
3. Fixed a bug that causes item weights to not apply properly
4. Experimenting with unsegmented health & energy bars
5. Experimenting with ping panels (alt and hold down left click to use)
6. Deleted some old debug code
